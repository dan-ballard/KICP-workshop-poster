# KICP workshop poster
Auxiliary figures for my poster "Dark energy cosmography with a triple source plane lens". Inside each folder, you will find...

**Arcs** - inner and outer arcs in I- and U-band HST data reconstructed simulatenously using our best fit model;

**Sources** - the corresponding background sources;

**Residuals** - the residuals between the best fit arcs and original data, divided by the noise;

**Posteriors** - posterior distributions of all our cosmological and lens model parameters;

**(WIP) constraining curvature** - _(very early!)_ demonstration of the potential to map different cosmologies onto our results (if we sample over distance ratios between lenses/sources instead of specific cosmological parameters).
