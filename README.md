# KICP workshop poster
Auxiliary figures for my poster "Dark energy cosmography with a triple source plane lens".

Folders structured as follows:

**Arcs** - inner and outer arcs in I- and U-band HST data reconstructed simulatenously using our best fit model;
**Sources** - the corresponding background sources;
**Residuals** - the residuals between the best fit arcs and original data, divided by the noise;
**Posteriors** - posterior distributions of all our cosmological and lens model parameters
**(WIP) constraining curvature** - _very early_ demonstration of the potential to map different cosmologies onto our results (if we sample over distance ratios between lenses/sources instead of specific cosmological parameters).
